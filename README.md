# Basics of tanstack-router

Due to a lack of type-safety from the react-router-dom (v6 as of writing this). I decided to delve into tanstack-router(V1) due to its 100% type-safety support.

Thank you to Leonardo for the excellent article covering on using the library. The code written here is just me copying over what he did. The difference is the added comments that I will be using to refer to in the future for my understanding.
